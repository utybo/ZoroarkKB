# Zoroark Knowledge Base (or KBZ for short)

This is the repository used on [kb.zoroark.guru](https://kb.zoroark.guru) to
provide information on everything.

ALL FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE THEIR OWNERS'. THE LICENSES DEPEND ON THE FILE.

## Guidelines for contribution

Adding files is done by adding an article to the `_articles` folder (follow
`mS2QS` as an example of what a more or less complete file may look like as I do
not have a full template ready right now), and all necessary content to the
`<id>` folder at the root of this repository if you need to add downloadable
files.

You must add the same id as the name of the `.md` file and in the `articleid`
field. The first letter should be the first letter of the category, and the
following characters should be short enough to identify the article. The ID must
be short.

Files that need to be excluded from the website should start with an underscore
`_` (note that `_articles`). This README is also excluded from the website.

To add files: simply fork this repository, make the changes on your fork, and
create a pull request. All files are accepted as long as the authors are clearly
defined, and that they do not break anyone's copyright.

**If your submission is only a PDF file,** and you don't want to spend time
creating the article yourself, open an issue and we will add them ourselves.
