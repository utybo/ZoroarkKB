# ZoroarkKB

This is the repository used on [kb.zoroark.guru](https://kb.zoroark.guru) to
provide information on everything.

ALL FILES IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE THEIR OWNERS'. THE LICENSES DEPEND ON THE FILE.

## Guidelines
Adding files is done by adding an article to the `_articles` folder (follow
`mS2QS` as an example), and all necessary content to the `<id>` folder at the
root of this repository if you need to add downloadable files.

You must add the same id as the name of the `.md` file and in the `articleid`
field. The first letter should be the first letter of the category, and the
following characters should be short enough to identify the article. The ID must
be short.

Files that need to be excluded from the website start with an underscore `_`
(don't worry about the `_articles` folder, it is properly included, while this
readme isn't).

To add files: simply fork this repository, make the changes on your fork, and
create a pull request. All files are accepted as long as the authors are clearly
defined, and that they do not break anyone's copyright.
