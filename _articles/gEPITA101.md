### Getting started at EPITA

This guide will tell you what you *need* to know when starting at EPITA.

THIS IS NOT AN OFFICIAL GUIDE, but it should have a lot of information you may
find useful.

#### Vocabulary shenanigans

Here is an overview of some of the terms used at EPITA which you may not be
familiar with.

##### Promos?

In EPITA (and most French schools), students are identified by their "promo"
year, meaning the year in which they should finish their school cursus. If you
begin EPITA in Prépa in 2018, then your promo is 2023, because you will finish
EPITA after 5 years of work in 2023.

##### S? ING?

A full cursus at EPITA lasts 5 years, cut like this:

* **Prépa**
  * Year 1: SUP
    * Semester 1 (S1)
    * Semester 2 (S2)
  * Year 2: SPE
    * Semester 3 (S3)
    * Semester 4 (S4): usually spent abroad or in Villejuif (called S4VJ)
* **ING**: Engineering cycle ("Cycle ingénieur")
  * Year 3: ING1
    * Semester 5 (S5)
    * Semester 6 (S6)
  * Year 4: ING2
    * Semester 7 (S7): usually an internship
    * Semester 8 (S8): first Majeure semester
  * Year 5: ING3
    * Semester 9 (S9): second Majeure semester
    * Semester 10 (S10): final internship

##### Villejuif? VJ? Kremlin-Bicêtre? KB?

There are two campuses in Paris for EPITA:

* Villejuif (aka VJ): For Prépa students, shared with the Sup Biotech school.
  ING students also go there for exams when there are not enough computers in
  KB. There are two buildings at VJ: VA (an actual building) and VB (premade
  building blocks, called "préfabriqués"). Another building is being built. 
* Kremlin-Bicêtre (aka KB): For ING students and for conferences for Prépa
  students. Shared with a lot of other schools from the Ionis group.

You need your student card to enter the campuses.

#### Credentials

At EPITA, students are identified by their "login", which is just
`firstname.lastname`. This has been in place since the 2021 promo: before then,
the format was `lastname_x`, where `x` is the first letter of the person's first
name.

Your EPITA e-mail address is your login with `@epita.fr` (so,
`firstname.lastname@epita.fr`). You MUST check it regularly as vital information
is sent there!

There are two credentials system used at EPITA:

* Bocal/Office 365: Managed by the Bocal (one of the infrastructures team at
  EPITA), this is what you use to log in to your email account and Office 365.
  You should receive the password via a text message before the first day. This
  is what you use to connect to all Microsoft login pages.
* CRI: Managed by the CRI, this is what you use to log in to the CRI's Intranet,
  and to the Programming intranets. You will define this password yourself: an
  e-mail will give you the exact procedure.

#### Discord Servers

Discord servers maintained by EPITA students are accessible to all EPITA
students (but are not accessible to non-students). You can go there to get help
and a lot of information in general. These servers are managed by the [EpiLogin](https://epilogin.fr)
students club, and you will have to follow a (simple) login procedure to ensure
that you are a student from EPITA.

To access them, use the following links:

* Promo servers: You should join your own promo's discord server:
  `epita.cf/promo`, replace promo by your own promo (e.g. 2024). You can also
  join other promos' servers, but you may get restricted access to the channels
  to avoid information leaking from older promos to newer ones.
* International (fourth semester) server: `epita.cf/international`. This server
  contains information and discussion channels related to international
  destinations: go there to get more info on where you can go and get feedback
  from students who have already been there.

Other servers also exist, but will not be listed here as they are more for
student clubs.

#### Software

You should get the following resources for free, as they are essential for your
work at EPITA:

* Microsoft Office: Use your Office 365 (aka Bocal) account to connect to [office.com](https://office.com).
  From there, you will be able to download the desktop Microsoft Office apps.
* JetBrains IDEs: You will use Rider and IntelliJ IDEA at EPITA, two Integrated
  Developer Environments (basically just very fancy text editors) from a company
  called JetBrains. While IntelliJ IDEA has a *very* popular free version
  available, Rider is not available for free. You can get all of these for free
  as part of JetBrains' student plan. [More details here](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/):
  use your EPITA email address to claim your rewards.

#### Programming languages

The following programming languages are taught at EPITA (accurate as of 2019):

* In SUP: OCaml (S1 only), C#, Python (only in Algorithmics classes)
* In SPE: C, Rust (S4VJ only), Python (only in Algorithmics classes)
* In ING1: C, C++, Python, Java, maybe others

#### Git

Since the 2023 promo, Git is used in SUP, SPE, and ING1. It is software that
basically allows you to manage your code in a nice, organized way. It is sort of
like iCloud, Mega or Google Drive, but instead of sending every file change you
make, you manage "packets of changes" (called commits). This way of managing
code leads to many benefits.

[Here is a simple introduction to Git for more information](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).
Also available in [French](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/index.fr.html).

EPITA uses something called "SSH keys" to ensure that only you can modify your
own repositories. [A guide is available here](https://doc.cri.epita.fr/git/).

#### Official Websites

There are several essential websites at EPITA that you will need to visit. The
following will give a broad description for each one of them but does not intend
to be an exhaustive list. **To get a nicer portal with all of the links here,
check out [epita.it](https://epita.it).**
