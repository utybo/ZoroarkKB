This document is a list of programming advises and common knowledge. After
reading it, you’ll be at least able to have some level of understanding of what
your code actually does. Its goal is to improve your programming abilities, or
at least give you a better understanding of computer-science related concepts.
The information given here is certainly not exhaustive. The tone is made to be
as light and clear as possible, and sometimes, the explanations may overlook
some technical subtleties, although I’ll do my best to prevent this from
happening, or to at least tell you when they do.

It is supposed to be called "First paper for INT1", but I (Matthieu) decided to
give it a more explicit name :P
